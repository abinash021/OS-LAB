#### [MySQL Basics]()
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). SQL-like languages can also be used in Relational Data Stream Management Systems (RDSMS), or in "not-only SQL" (NoSQL) databases.

- Database
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.
